# Betao Back-End assignment

## Problem A: The Overflowing Folder

You are working on a Django application, hosted on a virtual cloud server (e.g. an instance on Amazon EC2 or Google Cloud, a droplet on Digital Ocean, an Heroku Dyno...).

Your application collects user-uploaded documents and saves them in the folder `/media/documents`. That folder is located directly on the file system of your virtual server. 

The documents you are handling are small binary files (pdf-like), with a size ranging between 2Mb and 10Mb. All documents are accessed on a frequent basis, and it is important that they can be accessed fast if needed.

A (very summarized) codebase can be found just below.

```python
from django import models
from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage

fs = FileSystemStorage(location='/media/documents')

class Document(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    document = models.FileField(storage=fs)
    # ...
```

After a few years of operations, and after having collected 2 terabytes of documents, you realize that you are running out of storage on your server. At the current rate of writes, you will hit 0 space left in roughly 4 days. Your task is to find a way to keep your service up and running, without losing any data in the process.

For some reason, you are unable to add block storage or scale the file system capacity of your server. You can consider your instance "locked" in terms of resources. On the other hand, you still have access to all other services provided by your cloud host, and have access to reasonable budget if needs be.

Can you think of a few ways to get yourself out of this situation short-term, and what would be the best course of action you recommend? 

What would be a long-term fix and what would be the the steps required to implement? 

You can illustrate your solution with diagrams, commands, code or pseudocode, if you need.

## Problem B: The Money Schedule

Netao is a tech startup that got traction selling a web application for a one-time fee of 100€. The process is simple: the user would go on their website, buy the service using a credit card, and Netao would then deliver access to the web application. Payments are collected through a third-party credit card processor. 

A business developer at Netao wants to increase revenue by switching to a subscription-based model. He suggests that by offering a SaaS (software-as-a-service) solution to their clients and lowering the initial fee, Netao will be able to collect recurring revenue and increase their turnover.

The project was approved, and now the engineering team is in charge of creating a subscription engine that is able to collect fees from users every month, as well as lock out users from accessing the web application if their payment fails or the subscription is cancelled.

Currently, Netao sells the web application for a one-time fee of 100€. The business analyst suggests selling the web application for 50€ and collecting a monthly recurring fee of 20€ for continuous access. The first month of access would be included in the initial 50€ fee.


Below are the current partial implementations of the User, Product and Transaction models. Currently, there is only one product, so has_access (whether or not the user can use the software) has been left on the User model.

```
/** PSEUDOCODE **/

class User
    /* Unique identifier */
    int id
    /* Allows permanent access to the web application if the user has made a purchase */
    boolean has_access

class Product
    /* Unique identifier */
    int id
    string name
    /* Recommended price */ 
    int price

class Transaction:
    /* Buyer's ID */
    int user_id // buyer
    /* product paid for */
    int product_id
    /* date of purchase */
    date date
    /* actual price paid */
    int price
    
class UserAccess:
    /* The User who has access */
    int user_id
    /* The Product which is being accessed */
    int product_id
    /* Whether the user has access to that product */
    bool has_access
``` 

You have been assigned the task to enhance Netao's system to be able to handle multiple products, recurring subscriptions, and product access management. Here are the requirements we have gathered:

- Each Product has a recommended initial price and a recurring price.
- The initial price will be charged immediately as the user subscribes. The user will have access to the service for 30 days after the initial payment.
- The recurring price will be charged every 30 days, and will kick in after 30 days from the initial subscription. For example, if a user buys the service on `2021-01-01T00:00` and pays the initial price, the system will attempt to charge her the recurring price at `2021-01-31T00:00`, then on `2021-03-02T00:00`, and so forth.
- The system calls every hour a function "charge_subscriptions" that performs payments for every subscription that requires it.
- If a recurring payment fails, the user will lose access to the service, and no further attempts at collecting payments will be made.
- The system needs to persist every payment made, by who, when and for what product.
- Each user can have multiple subscriptions running concurrently, but only one subscription per product.

## Tasks
1. Suggest a Python class model to support those requirements. The new data model needs to be able to express and persist:
    - transactions (payments made)
    - subscriptions ("User A is subscribed to product B")
    - product accesses ("Does User A have access to Product B at this datetime?")
   
The model does not need to implement any method yet, but if during your work you decided to write some methods to try out your models, there is no downside in leaving them in the submission.

2. Write a function `should_charge` that takes as input a set of Users from the model you suggested in the question above and a datetime, and that returns all users that should be charged until that date and for how much, as a list of strings. As stated in the requirements, users should be charged a month after their last successful payment on any subscription they belong to, unless their subscription has already been cancelled by failing a payment. 
The function will be used in the `charge_subscriptions` method to generate a list of users to charge.

Example use of `should_charge`:
```python
   # users is a list that holds your model of users as defined in the answer to question 1
   should_charge(users=users, dt=datetime.now()) -> ['bob@betao.se: 290kr', 'john@betao.se: 290kr']
```

Mock all data necessary in order to run the function. Examples of a dataset for testing the function given below (not required to be used). Do not use a database.
```
Users: 
  bob@betao.se - last successful payment: 2021-01-01T00:00:00 - subscribed to Product A
  john@betao.se - last successful payment: 2021-01-15T00:00:00 - subscribed to Product A
  peter@betao.se - last successful payment: 2021-01-15T00:00:00 - subscribed to Product B
  andrew@betao.se - last successful payment: 2021-01-17T00:00:00 - subscribed to Product B
  boris@betao.se - last successful payment: 2020-12-15T00:00:00 - subscribed to Product A
  boris@betao.se - last successful payment: 2020-12-15T00:00:00 - subscribed to Product B
Products:
  Product A: 59€ initial, 29€ recurring
  Product B: 109€ initial, 10.9€ recurring
Current date: 2021-02-16
```


Bonus:
3. Write a function that takes an user and a product as input, and returns if the user is currently able to access that product (as a boolean).
